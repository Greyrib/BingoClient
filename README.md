# BingoClient

A project swiftly made using Unity, meant to be used by everyone at the Bingo Tutor event day, for playing.
It was later realized, actually making printed boards would turn out easier & more time-efficient (note, this entire Bingo-thing was made during half a weekend).

Internally, a separate Unity project was made, for a host-program to pull the numbers, optinally sort them & verify against pulled numbers from clients when winning a prize.
We can happily report it was the day's most succesful event, with cinema-tickets for primary winners, and various nommy prizes for the rest.
The final winner was brought home by his lucky 11, sought after for quite a few number-pulls before eventually finishing the event.

A screenshot of the host-program is shown here:
